                                index.html contains just a simple "home page".
                                
                                family.html contains some info about my family. Used table and bootstrap grid to present data.

                                whisky.html contains ordered list with my 5 favourite whiskies.

                                aboutme.html contains only a picture.

                                sass.html contains only sass inheritance.

                                This project is a tribute to all "home pages" that everyone had in mid 90s.
